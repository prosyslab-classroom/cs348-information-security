# CS448: Introduction to Information Security

This is the Github repository for CS448 at KAIST.
For the details of the course, visit the [course webpage](https://sites.google.com/view/cs448/home).
Announcements and QnA will be posted in the [issue board](https://github.com/prosyslab-classroom/cs448-2021-spring/issues).

## Homework
This course includes written and programming assignments.
Students will use a few tools which are described below.

### Git, Github, and Github Classroom
We will use Github/Github Classroom to provide assignment templates and manage submissions.
Make sure you have a Github account and get the [student developer pack benefits](https://education.github.com/pack).
Moreover, student should get familiar with `git`.
If you are new to `git`, see this [book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

All submissions will be managed using Github. For each assignment, a unique invitation URL for Github Classroom will be posted in the [issue board](https://github.com/prosyslab-classroom/cs448-2021-spring/issues).
Once you accept the invitation, a private repository for your assignment will be created.
You can push as many commits as you want before the deadline. We will grade the final commit of your `master` branch.
The late homework policy is as follows:
  - You are given 5 “grace days” (extra time without any penalty)
  - Once you have run out of grace, late submissions will be discounted 30% per day

### OCaml
Students will use the [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) programming language for the software security assignments. For more details of OCaml, see the following meterials:

### LLVM
Students will use the [LLVM](https://llvm.org) infrastructure and implement various tools that analyze programs written in LLVM IR code.
LLVM IR code can be generated from many source languages such as C/C++/Obj-C, Swift, Rust, Scala, Haskell, WebAssembly, etc.
For more details of LLVM, see this [document](https://llvm.org/docs).
